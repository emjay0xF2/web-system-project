Stretching from Geneva in the west to Lausanne in the east, Lake Geneva is one of Switzerland’s most beautiful places. From the international bustle of Geneva to 
the many vineyards that crawl up the hillsides around the lake, there’s plenty to do in the surrounding region. And there’s a lot of activity on the lake, too. 
Windsurfing, water skiing, and kayaking are all possible for more active visitors to the area. Or, if you’re feeling a little lazier, you can simply sit back and take in 
the beauty of the lake from the deck of a paddle steamer as it crosses the water.

The Jungfraujoch is an Alpine wonderland that fully deserves its nickname of the Top of Europe. Technically a glacier saddle between two mountains, the 
Jungfraujoch is one the best – and highest – attractions in Switzerland. And don’t let the altitude put you off – there’s plenty for the whole family up there, from 
mountain climbing to tobogganing and much more. However, perhaps the most impressive attraction is the world-famous Jungfrau railway. Starting at Kleine 
Scheidegg, the train climbs up to 3,454 meters above sea level to Jungfraujoch, the highest railway station in Europe.

In a country of picture-perfect lakeside cities, it doesn’t get much more impressive than Lucerne. Surrounded by three large mountains, the compact medieval 
city sits on the shores of Lake Lucerne. Wandering around the captivating old town, you’ll be forgiven for thinking you’ve stepped into a painting. There are 
ancient churches, bustling squares, and plenty of boutiques to explore as you marvel at the architectural wonder of the city. But the highlight is the Chapel 
Bridge, a covered wooden bridge that has been connecting the center of Lucerne since 1333.

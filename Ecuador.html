Sacha Lodge is one of the most respected beacons of sustainability in the Ecuadorian Amazon and offers extraordinary jungle experiences, including a private
canopy walking trail that is out of this world. Nestled in the heart of pristine jungle, Sacha’s amazing conservation efforts have resulted in it becoming the 
single biggest private reserve in the country’s Amazonian basin. In this luscious yet dense jungle, wildlife watching can be tricky so the 245m-long canopy trail,
built 30m above ground, offers an unparalleled viewing experience. Our Sacha Lodge stay is one of our favourite things to do in Ecuador and we think you’ll 
also fall in love with this magical place.

If you’re after an immersive travel experience in Ecuador, look no further than the luxury train ride from Quito to Guayaquil. From the highest peak of the
highlands to the balmy coast, the 4-day Tren Crucero journey meanders through fantastical landscapes, and is a slow-travel experience that delivers on all 
counts: heavenly scenery, amazing service and delightful cuisine. If that’s not enough to convince you, do note that Guayaquil is the second casting-off point 
for visits to the Galapagos so if you’re landing in the capital intent on visiting the islands, and have a few days to spare, there really isn’t a better way to 
stretch and enjoy that amazing transfer.

The jagged crevasses that tumble into the crystalline waters of Santa Cruz’s southern coast offer jaw-dropping swimming and kayaking. The ethereal canyons 
have traditionally been one of the Galapagos’ most hidden of treasures yet thanks to their Instagrammable beauty they are now among the most coveted. Head
here either before or after your yacht trip and discover yet another startling corner of these incredible isles.

Also known as the Northern Palace, the large <a href="https://www.royalpalace.go.kr:8443/html/eng_gbg/main/main.jsp"target="_blank">Gyeongbokgung Palace</a> complex has gone through some incredible turmoil over the years. It was first built in 1395 
during the Joseon dynasty, which built five grand palaces around Seoul. The palace has been bombed, destroyed, and rebuilt several times, occupied by the 
Japanese (first in 1592), and only finally restored in 1990.

Be sure to check out Gyeonghoeru Pavilion and Hyangwonjeong Pond, two of the remaining original structures from the Joseon period.

The palace compound can be explored on a guided walking tour. There are also two museums inside the grounds (the National 
Palace Museum and the National Folk Museum), both worth a visit.

Address: 161 Sajik-ro, Sejongno, Jongno-gu, Seoul

Boasting almost 400,000 cherry trees, some over 100 years old, Jinhae is the best place in Korea to enjoy cherry trees blossoming with flowers each spring. 
This small town, located along South Korea's southern coast, hosts the country's most popular annual cherry blossom festival. Over a million visitors a year 
come to Jinhae just to see the cherry blossoms.

Formally known as Gunhangjae (Naval Port Festival), the Jinhae cherry blossom festival takes place in late March or early April, depending on when the 
trees are in flower. Head to Yeojwacheon stream and Jinhae's Gyeonghwa train station for some of the best blossom viewing. You can also enjoy the 
festival's food markets, public art installations, and live performances.

Getting from Seoul to Jinhae is easy via South Korea's high-speed ATX train â€” the journey takes just under three hours.

Like the Yosemite of Korea, this majestic natural wonderland (Korea's first national park) has mountains, lakes, waterfalls, streams, and miles of hiking trails that
allow you to explore them.

This park is known for its natural diversity, as it has over 1,500 different animal species and over 1,000 different kinds of plants. There are also two Buddhist 
temples inside the park, one known as the "Temple of a Hundred Pools" due to all the ponds around it fed by mountain streams.

When you get tired of walking, there's a cable car that will take you up Seoraksan Mountain for some incredible views of the mountains and valleys. It takes about
four hours by bus or three hours by car to reach the park from Seoul.

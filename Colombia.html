Cartagena is the crown jewel of Colombia's Caribbean coast and one of the best-preserved colonial destinations in the Americas. Take a stroll through the historic
walled city, and you may feel as if you've stepped back in time to a different era.

Maybe it's the 13 kilometers of centuries-old walls, or the colorful colonial architecture, many of which are now beautifully restored restaurants and luxury hotels. 
Perhaps it's the bougainvillea-covered balconies along the labyrinthine streets or the soaring Catholic churches that tower above every plaza. Whatever it is, 
visitors can't help but fall for this Caribbean charmer.

Beyond the old city center lies laid-back Getsemani, and along the oceanfront is Bocagrande, a newer part of town, where upscale condos and hotels fight for 
prime seafront real estate. And less than an hour away by boat are islands and beaches, offering ideal places to visit for getaways and day trips.

You'll find some of the best beaches in Colombia within the protected Tayrona National Natural Park, which is known for its palm-shaded coves and crystal-clear
coastal lagoons. Most beaches are set against the dramatic mountains of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, whose rainforested hills make for a great side trip on
any beach vacation.

Tayrona is also a fantastic place for snorkeling at protected areas near La Piscina beach and Cabo San Juan. Though remote, these secluded beaches aren't 
exactly a secret, so it's best to visit in low season (February to November) to avoid the massive crowds. Also, unless you're paying for the lavish Ecohabs Tayrona,
be prepared to sleep in a tent (or hammock) at one of the many beachside campgrounds.

Most visitors to Colombia will inevitably begin their trip in Bogota, the nation's largest city. It's a city that often divides opinion, with some complaining of its
gridlocked streets and sometimes dreary weather, and others falling head over heels for its unique combination of colonial charm and urban sophistication. 
Either way, this city of eight million tends to grow on people who give it enough time.

Begin your sightseeing in Bogota in the historic center of La Candelaria, where you'll find the impressive buildings lining Plaza de Bolívar and can't-miss 
cultural attractions like the blindingly bright Museum of Gold. Then, head over to the wealthier neighborhoods of North Bogotá for some of the nation's best 
boutique shops and chef-driven restaurants.

For a bird's eye view of the city, be sure to take a trip up on the cable car to the Sanctuary of Monserrate. While up there settle in for a delightful and 
leisurely lunch or dinner at Casa San Isidro, serving fine Italian food, or enjoy Colombian food at the historical Santa Clara House dating from 1924.

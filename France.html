Cite de Carcassonne is an historic fortified city in the Languedoc-Roussillon region. The city dates back about 2,500 years and became part of France in the 
mid-13th century. At one time it was the center of the French woolen textile industry. A 19th-century restoration project of the Cit√© turned Carcassonne into 
the popular tourist destination it is today.

Mont Saint Michel is a small tidal island located just off the coast of Normandy. A spectacular and well-preserved Norman Benedictine Abbey of St Michel stands
at the peak of the rocky island, surrounded by the winding streets and convoluted architecture of the medieval town. A causeway connects the mainland with the 
island.

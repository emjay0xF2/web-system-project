One of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe, the city of Venice is spread over a series of islands, with the canals that criss cross the city providing a 
wonderful method of transport around the city. While hiring a gondolier to allow you to see the sights from the water can prove to be quite expensive, there are 
plenty of boat trips that you can take that won’t break the bank.

This iconic building is one of the best known attractions in the country, and while it was originally built as a bell tower, it actually started to lean almost as soon as 
it was built. Since being completed, the soft ground has continued to give beneath the tower, and today the lean of the tower is around four meters.

<li><h1>Pompeii</h1></li>

The town of Pompeii was a thriving place in the first century AD, but the eruption from the nearby volcano covered the town in a thick layer of ash. This ash 
preserved the city, giving modern historians a treasure trove of insights into life during this period of history, and today it is a wonderful place to explore.

Mention Pompeii and most travelers think of ancient Roman villas, prancing bronze fauns, writhing plaster casts of Vesuvius's victims, and the fabled days of the 
emperors. Millions of culture seekers worldwide continue to head for ancient Pompeii every year, but a similar number of Italian pilgrims converge on the new 
town's 19th-century basilica, the Santuario della Madonna del Rosario, as a token of faith—joining processions, making ex-voto offerings, or just honoring a vow. 
Wealthy Neapolitans come to make their donations to help the church carry out its good deeds. New car-owners even come to get their vehicles blessed—and 
given driving standards in these parts of the world, insurance coverage from on high is probably a sensible move.

Caught between the hammer and anvil of cultural and religious tourism, the modern town of Pompei has shaken off its rather complacent approach and is now 
endeavoring to polish up its act. In attempts to ease congestion, parts of the town have been made pedestrian-friendly and parking restrictions tightened. 
Departing from the rather sleazy reputation of previous years, several hotels have filled the sizable niche in the market for quality deals at affordable prices. As 
for recommendable restaurants, if you deviate from the archaeological site and make for the center of town, your choices will include two restaurants specializing
in ancient Roman recipes, historically accurate but no less delicious for that. The modern town may be a circus, but the center ring is always the splendors and 
wonders of ancient Pompeii itself.
